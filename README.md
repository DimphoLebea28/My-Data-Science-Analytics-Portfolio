## 2. Predicting Temperature Variations Based on CO2 Emissions in the Agri-Food Sector
### Project Overview
This project aimed to analyze CO2 emissions in the agri-food sector over 30 years and predict their impact on temperature variations. Using datasets from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we identified key emission sources and developed predictive models to support sustainable agricultural practices.

### My Role & Key Contribution
As one of three team members responsible for model development, I built a Random Forest Regression model, which outperformed the other models with an RÂ² of 62.02%, making it the most accurate in predicting temperature variations. My contributions included:

- Model Selection & Training: Developed and fine-tuned the Random Forest model to achieve optimal predictive performance.
- Feature Engineering: Processed and selected key variables to improve model accuracy.
- Performance Evaluation: Conducted a comparative analysis against Gradient Boosting Regressor (RÂ² = 55.59%) and Decision Tree Regression (RÂ² = 20.64%) to ensure the best model was selected.
- Data Visualization: Created bar plots to illustrate model comparisons and insights.
### Outcome & Impact
The project confirmed a strong link between CO2 emissions and temperature rise, highlighting the need for sustainable agricultural practices. The predictive models developed can be used by stakeholders to implement targeted strategies to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change.
