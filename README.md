# My-Data-Science-Analytics-Portfolio
Welcome to my data science and analytics portfolio! This repository showcases the projects I have worked on, demonstrating my skills in data analysis, machine learning, business intelligence, and geospatial analytics. Each project includes datasets, code, visualizations, and insights gained from the analysis.

#  About Me
I am a passionate Data Analyst and aspiring Data Scientist with a background in Python, SQL, Power BI, and machine learning. I have completed a Data Science Certificate at ExploreAI and gained hands-on experience during my internship at Sand Technologies, where I worked on real-world data-driven solutions. My expertise includes predictive modeling, data visualization, geospatial analysis, and business intelligence.

## 1.Anime Recommendation System Using Machine Learning
### Project Overview
This project aimed to develop an automated anime recommendation system using machine learning to enhance user experience by providing personalized anime suggestions. By leveraging content-based filtering and collaborative filtering, the system analyzes user preferences and anime characteristics to deliver relevant recommendations.

### My Role & Key Contribution
I was responsible for data cleaning and preparation, ensuring the dataset was structured and optimized for model training. Additionally, I created the presentation slides summarizing key insights, methodology, and findings. My contributions included:

- Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, removed inconsistencies, and standardized anime metadata.
- Feature Engineering: Transformed categorical features and numerical ratings for better model performance.
- Dataset Integrity Checks: Ensured accurate data representation for meaningful recommendations.
- Presentation Development: Designed and structured slides to effectively communicate project insights.
### Outcome & Impact
The recommendation system successfully provided personalized anime suggestions based on user preferences, improving content discoverability and engagement. By implementing machine learning models, the system enhances user satisfaction and streamlines anime selection, making it a valuable tool for anime enthusiasts.

## 2. Predicting Temperature Variations Based on CO2 Emissions in the Agri-Food Sector
### Project Overview
This project aimed to analyze CO2 emissions in the agri-food sector over 30 years and predict their impact on temperature variations. Using datasets from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we identified key emission sources and developed predictive models to support sustainable agricultural practices.

### My Role & Key Contribution
As one of three team members responsible for model development, I built a Random Forest Regression model, which outperformed the other models with an R² of 62.02%, making it the most accurate in predicting temperature variations. My contributions included:

- Model Selection & Training: Developed and fine-tuned the Random Forest model to achieve optimal predictive performance.
- Feature Engineering: Processed and selected key variables to improve model accuracy.
- Performance Evaluation: Conducted a comparative analysis against Gradient Boosting Regressor (R² = 55.59%) and Decision Tree Regression (R² = 20.64%) to ensure the best model was selected.
- Data Visualization: Created bar plots to illustrate model comparisons and insights.
### Outcome & Impact
The project confirmed a strong link between CO2 emissions and temperature rise, highlighting the need for sustainable agricultural practices. The predictive models developed can be used by stakeholders to implement targeted strategies to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change.

## 3.Automated News Classification Using Machine Learning
### Project Overview
This project aimed to develop an automated news classification system to categorize news articles into predefined categories such as Business, Technology, Sports, Education, and Entertainment using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. The goal was to enhance content organization, improve user experience, and increase operational efficiency for news outlets. The final model was deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application for easy usability.

### My Role & Key Contribution
I was responsible for data cleaning and preparation, ensuring the dataset was structured and optimized for model training. Additionally, I created the presentation slides summarizing key insights, methodology, and findings. My contributions included:

- Data Preprocessing: Removed URLs, punctuation, stopwords, and performed text normalization (stemming & lemmatization).
- Feature Engineering: Transformed text data into numerical features for model training.
- Dataset Integrity Checks: Ensured there were no missing values or inconsistencies.
- Presentation Development: Designed and structured slides to effectively communicate project insights.
### Outcome & Impact
The Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier was selected as the best-performing model, achieving high accuracy in classifying news articles. The deployed Streamlit web app allows users to input news articles and receive real-time category predictions, offering a scalable solution for editorial teams to manage content efficiently.
