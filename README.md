# My-Data-Science-Analytics-Portfolio
Welcome to my data science and analytics portfolio! This repository showcases the projects I have worked on, demonstrating my skills in data analysis, machine learning, business intelligence, and geospatial analytics. Each project includes datasets, code, visualizations, and insights gained from the analysis.

# 🔍 About Me
I am a passionate Data Analyst and aspiring Data Scientist with a background in Python, SQL, Power BI, and machine learning. I have completed a Data Science Certificate at ExploreAI and gained hands-on experience during my internship at Sand Technologies, where I worked on real-world data-driven solutions. My expertise includes predictive modeling, data visualization, geospatial analysis, and business intelligence.

## Anime Recommender System
Project Type: Machine Learning | Recommender System
Project Overview:
This project focuses on building a personalized anime recommender system using both Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering techniques. The goal is to predict how a user will rate an unseen anime based on their historical viewing preferences and the content features of anime titles.

## My Role
I collaborated with a team to develop the system, with my primary responsibilities being:

✔ Cleaning the dataset to ensure data consistency.

✔ Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights and trends.

## Key Objectives

✅ Build a Collaborative Filtering model to recommend anime based on user similarities.

✅ Develop a Content-Based Filtering model that recommends anime based on content features.

✅ Analyze and visualize genre distributions and rating trends to refine recommendations.

✅ Optimize model performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Data Processing & EDA
The dataset consisted of over 5.7 million user-anime interactions, including details such as ratings, genres, episode counts, and popularity metrics. I was responsible for:

✔ Handling missing values and duplicate data to improve model accuracy.

✔ Merging datasets to create a structured input for training models.

## Key Insights
📌 Most Frequent Genre: Hentai

📌 Average Rating: 6.47 (on a scale of 1-10)

📌 Highest Member Count: 1,013,917 users

## Visualizing Trends
To better understand user preferences, I used WordCloud to visualize genre distributions and histograms/KDE plots to analyze rating trends. These insights helped in fine-tuning the recommendation system for better accuracy and user satisfaction.

## Technologies Used
🛠 Languages: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

📊 Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud

🔍 Techniques: Collaborative & Content-Based Filtering

## Project Outcomes
✅ Successfully cleaned and processed large-scale anime data.

✅ Developed a functional anime recommendation system that enhances user experience.

✅ Improved model accuracy by analyzing and adjusting rating distributions.
