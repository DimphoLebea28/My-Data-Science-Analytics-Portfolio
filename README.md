    <h2>Anime Recommender System</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Machine Learning | Recommender System</p>
    
    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
        This project aims to build a personalized **Anime Recommender System** using both **Collaborative Filtering** and **Content-Based Filtering** techniques. 
        The system predicts how a user will rate an unseen anime based on historical viewing preferences and content features. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>
        As part of a collaborative team, my primary responsibilities included **cleaning the dataset** and performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to extract meaningful insights.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Objectives</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Develop a **Collaborative Filtering** model to recommend anime based on user similarities.</li>
        <li>Create a **Content-Based Filtering** model to recommend anime using title features.</li>
        <li>Analyze and visualize **genre distributions** and **rating trends** to enhance recommendations.</li>
        <li>Optimize model performance using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data Processing & EDA</h3>
    <p>
        The dataset included over **5.7 million user-anime interactions**, with details such as **ratings, genres, episode counts, and popularity metrics**. 
        My role involved **data cleaning**, **handling missing values**, and **merging datasets** to create a structured input for model training.  
    </p>
    
    <h4>Key Insights</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>**Most Frequent Genre:** Hentai</li>
        <li>**Average Rating:** 6.47 (on a scale of 1-10)</li>
        <li>**Highest Member Count:** 1,013,917 users</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Visualizing Trends</h3>
    <p>
        To better understand user preferences, I generated and visualized **genre frequencies** using a **WordCloud** and analyzed **rating distributions** with histograms and KDE plots.  
        These insights helped fine-tune the recommendation models for **better accuracy and user satisfaction**.
    </p>

    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Languages:</strong> Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)</li>
        <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud</li>
        <li><strong>Techniques:</strong> Collaborative & Content-Based Filtering</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Project Outcomes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Successfully **cleaned and processed** large-scale anime data.</li>
        <li>Developed a working **anime recommendation system** that enhances user experience.</li>
        <li>Improved model accuracy by **analyzing and adjusting rating distributions**.</li>
    </ul>
